## XMAS

Building a Bluetooth remote controlled Christmas light show

This project combines simple woodworking with electronics to produce a remote control Christmas decoration. Get yourself in the Christmas spirit from the comfort of your own armchair. The skills and techniques of this project can be used in a wide range of other projects.
The decoration is in the form of the 4 letters of XMAS. These are filled with green and red LEDs which are controlled by an Arduino.
