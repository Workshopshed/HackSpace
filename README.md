## XMAS

Building a Bluetooth remote controlled Christmas light show

This project combines simple woodworking with electronics to produce a remote control Christmas decoration. Get yourself in the Christmas spirit from the comfort of your own armchair. The skills and techniques of this project can be used in a wide range of other projects.
The decoration is in the form of the 4 letters of XMAS. These are filled with green and red LEDs which are controlled by an Arduino.

## MUSIC BOX

Marvellous mechanical music box

## ROBOTIC WATER SENTRY

The robot water sentry uses the Google AIY Vision kit to detect humans an squirt them with water.

To make it easy to turn on and off there's a Pimoroni On/Off shim. After further research it was concluded that the default installer for this works just fine.
